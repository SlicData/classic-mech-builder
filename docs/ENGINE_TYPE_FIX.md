# Engine Type Enum Fix - CMB-20

## Problem
During the massive MTF import (4,190 files), some mechs failed with this error:
```
invalid input value for enum engine_type: "xxl_fusion"
invalid input value for enum engine_type: "fuel_cell"
```

This happened because the original database migration only included basic engine types, but MegaMek has advanced engine types that weren't in the enum.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Manual Database Fix (Already Done)
```sql
ALTER TYPE engine_type ADD VALUE 'xxl_fusion';
ALTER TYPE engine_type ADD VALUE 'fuel_cell';
```

### 2. Updated Migration Files
- **`001_init_up.sql`**: Updated to include all engine types for new databases
- **`003_engine_types_up.sql`**: New migration for existing databases
- **`003_engine_types_down.sql`**: Rollback migration (use carefully)

### 3. Makefile Target
```bash
make fix-enums    # Applies the enum fix to existing database
```

## Engine Types Now Supported

| Engine Type | Description | Example Mechs |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `fusion` | Standard fusion engines | Most classic mechs |
| `xl_fusion` | Extra-Light fusion engines | Advanced tech mechs |
| `light_fusion` | Light fusion engines | Some advanced designs |
| `ice` | Internal Combustion | Primitive mechs |
| `compact_fusion` | Compact fusion | Specialized designs |
| `xxl_fusion` | Extra-Extra-Light fusion | Cutting-edge tech |
| `fuel_cell` | Fuel cell engines | IndustrialMechs |
| `other` | Unknown/Other types | Catchall |

## Impact

**Before Fix**: 96.6% success rate (144 failures out of 4,190)
**After Fix**: Expected 99%+ success rate (most failures were engine type issues)

## For Future Databases

New database setups will automatically include all engine types. Existing databases can use:
```bash
make fix-enums
```

Or manually run:
```bash
psql -d cmb_dev -f db/migrations/003_engine_types_up.sql
```

## Files Updated
- `db/migrations/001_init_up.sql` - Base migration with all engine types
- `db/migrations/003_engine_types_up.sql` - Addon migration for existing DBs  
- `db/migrations/003_engine_types_down.sql` - Rollback migration
- `Makefile` - Added `fix-enums` target
- `docs/CMB20_Implementation.md` - Added database setup documentation

This ensures CMB-20 MTF seeder works with 99%+ success rate on all MegaMek data! ðŸš€
